      "introduction": "Read the text and look at the graph. The average temperature has increased by over 0.7 degrees in the last 100 years. In the context of climate, this is considered a significant and rapid increase. Historically, the ocean has played a crucial role in stabilizing the climate by storing heat. Over the past 50 years, the oceans have absorbed over 90 percent of the temperature increase caused by climate change. This now puts the oceans under great pressure and undergoes significant changes.",
      "question": "How has the ocean historically helped to keep the Earth's climate stable?",
      "incorrect_answers": [
        "The ocean cools the Earth when needed.",
        "The ocean freezes into ice in winter.",
        "Most of all rain ends up in the ocean."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Increased temperatures have been stored in the ocean.",
      "feedback": "Over the past 50 years, the ocean has 'absorbed' over 90 percent of the increased temperature caused by climate change.",

      "introduction": "In the Nordic region, our climate depends on the Gulf Stream bringing warmer water from southern latitudes and warming up our countries here in the north. Due to climate changes in the ocean, researchers see that the Gulf Stream is moving slower and threatens to stop moving. This would have significant consequences, not only for the ocean itself but for everyone living near the Gulf Stream.",
      "question": "What would happen to us in the Nordic region if the Gulf Stream stopped moving?",
      "incorrect_answers": [
        "It would become warmer temperatures.",
        "Water in rivers would start flowing in the opposite direction.",
        "The Baltic Sea would have higher salinity."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "It would become colder temperatures.",
      "feedback": "The temperature in the Nordic region would decrease without the Gulf Stream, as it brings warm water to us in the north, making our climate warmer. Without the Gulf Stream, it could be -50 degrees Celsius in winter in some parts of Sweden, and also drier summers.",

      "introduction": "The most tangible effects of climate change are seen in the oceans. One of the most noticeable consequences is the rising sea level. Warming of the oceans, increased volume of seawater, and melting glaciers and ice caps are the main causes of this phenomenon. The oceans cover 71 percent of the Earth's surface and generate over half of all the oxygen in the atmosphere, which is what we need to breathe. The oceans absorb about 30 percent of the carbon dioxide in the air, which is what we exhale.",
      "question": "What happens in the ocean when glaciers and ice caps melt?",
      "incorrect_answers": [
        "There are more volcanic eruptions in Iceland.",
        "There is too little fish in the ocean.",
        "The water becomes colder."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Sea level rises.",
      "feedback": "There is more seawater when the ice melts, causing the sea level to rise. This, in turn, forces people and animals living near the ocean to move as their homes and fields become flooded. The ice also cools the globe. When it disappears, it gets warmer, and the weather becomes more extreme. This is also a reason why people have to flee their homes. Many climate refugees have nowhere to go.",

      "question": "1 of 3. What is the greenhouse effect?",

        "What happens in the clouds when it rains.",
        "What causes climate change.",
        "Another word for summer weather."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A process that prevents all of the Earth's heat from escaping into space.",
      "feedback": "The greenhouse effect is a natural process needed on Earth so that not all heat escapes straight into space but stays in our atmosphere. Without it, it would be so cold on Earth that nothing could live here. The problem is the enhanced greenhouse effect created by us humans. It means that we release too many greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, causing the greenhouse gas layer to become too thick, and too much heat stays on Earth.",

      "feedback": "We can reduce our emissions, among other things, by: Switching to renewable energy instead of oil. This way, we release much less carbon dioxide. Eating less meat. Livestock releases a lot of methane gas. Stop cutting down forests. Trees bind carbon dioxide, preventing it from going into the atmosphere.",

      "introduction": "The world's oceans cover over 70 percent of the Earth's surface. Therefore, the oceans are important for regulating the world's climate. When the water becomes warmer in the ocean, life in the ocean changes. Species that prefer colder water move north, while species that require warmer water spread more and more. It changes the entire ecosystem in the ocean. Heatwaves in the ocean are becoming more common, affecting temperature-sensitive corals in tropical waters particularly hard. Corals need to live together with a specific type of algae to thrive. These algae do not thrive and die when the water becomes too warm. This makes corals pale and starve to death. When corals die, a large part of the ocean's ecosystem is threatened. Many fish and other marine animals live in coral reefs and do not thrive anywhere else.",
      "question": "What would happen if coral reefs disappeared?",
      "incorrect_answers": [
        "It would be easier to fish with nets.",
        "Water temperature would decrease.",
        "Fish and other marine animals would thrive better."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "Many fish and other marine animals would die out.",
      "feedback": "If coral reefs disappear, many fish and marine animals would be without their home. Coral reefs are one of the Earth's largest ecosystems. Researchers are currently trying to find a more heat-resistant type of algae that can thrive in warm water. This could save the corals from extinction.",
